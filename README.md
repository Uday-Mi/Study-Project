# Study-Project

The Github Repository contains the code of a Research Article, written by Dr. Hsu-Yung Cheng, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, No. 300, Jhongda Road, Jhongli City, Taoyuan County, Taiwan. The link for the Research Article is http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.01.077 
The Research Article is also uploaded in the Repository. 
I have tried to write the Code for the research article as a Study Project work under Dr. Sumanta Pasari, Department of Mathematics, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Rajasthan. 
I have not been successful in implemnting Kalman Filter, as a part of project.
But the repository contains the data and its analyses, which can be used for furthur analysis and implementation.
